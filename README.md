# Backend-Assignment-Enso

This is my first attempt in implemeting REST API

## Before you run this project
Place a .env file in the root directory of the project
The .env file must contain one enrty: PRIVATE_KEY and the value should be generated from https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/

See .env.template

## Run with postman
The preffered way to test this API is with Postman. I added a postman collection to the repository.
